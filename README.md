# ATM Application 

# Overview

# Features

Check Balance: Displays the current balance of the account.
Withdraw Money: Allows the user to withdraw a specified amount, and updates the balance accordingly.

Code

The main logic of the ATM is implemented in the ATM.java file, which uses basic Java control flow statements like if-else and while loop to handle different user inputs.
